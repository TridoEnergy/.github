# Trido Energy Services

## About Us
In 2009, amidst the terrains of Pink Mountain, BC, the Trido team embarked on what was to be a routine installation of a plunger lift system. However, what they encountered would set the stage for a remarkable leap in renewable energy technology. Discovering unused solar power chemical pumps, a failed attempt by the client to adopt zero-emission solutions revealed a gap in the market for efficient and reliable renewable energy systems.

Trido, driven by a profound commitment to environmental sustainability and client satisfaction, saw this not as a setback, but an opportunity. The discovery was a catalyst, inspiring the team to develop a solution that not only met but exceeded the client's net-zero objectives. This commitment led to the creation of initial prototypes, offered free of charge, marking the beginning of a journey towards innovation and excellence.

## Mission & Vision
Trido is empowering operational performance by designing equipment and building systems with superior reliability while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We are proud to support environmental sustainability and contribute to the global commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
